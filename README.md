#  Research work originated at WSU

## 1. OpenSim models based on the Visible Human Project

* ### VHM model
* ### VHF model
* ### subject-specific model


## 2. Size-matched model pairs 
* ### Model model pairs based on the male model
* ### Model model pairs based on the female model
* ### Look into the effects of sex-dfferences in skeletal size and muscle size on neck strength

## 3. Using Dynamic Stereo X-Ray (DSX) data
* ### Try to use DSX-based kinematics data
* ### Look into the effects of DSX-based kinematics data on model prediction (using inverse dynamics)
